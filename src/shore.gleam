/// A shore application is made up of these base parts. Following The Elm
/// Architecture, you must define an init, view and update function which shore
/// will handle calling.
///
/// Additionally, a simple subject to pass the exit call to is required.
/// keybinding for the framework level events such as exiting and ui focusing.
/// And finally redraw for defining when the applicaiton should be redrawn, either on update messages or on a timer.
///
/// `init` and `update` functions second argument `List(fn() -> Msg)` is an
/// "effects handler". You can pass effectful/blocking code here such as
/// requests to databases, file system io, network requests and they will be
/// automatically passed to a separate, unlinked, erlang process which will call
/// update for you on their return. See the `reader` example for practical usage
/// examples.
